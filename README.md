# Neural Network Optimisation Using Evolutionary Based Algorithms


This repository contains an implementation of a neural network using evolutionary based algorithms for optimization. The goal of this research project is to investigate the effectiveness of using evolutionary algorithms to optimize the architecture and parameters of a neural network. The implementation of the neural network is done from scratch, which means that it is not based on any pre-existing neural network libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## How to Use

To run the evolutionary algorithm experiment on the MNIST dataset, you would run the following command:
```
python evolutionary_mnist.py
```
You can also modify the scripts to change the parameters of the experiments, such as the population size or number of generations for the evolutionary algorithm.
